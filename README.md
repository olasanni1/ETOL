# Extensible Trajectory Optimization Library (ETOL)

![ETOL Logo](./resource/images/etol.png)

## Overview

The Extensible Trajectory Optimization Library (ETOL) was created to help researchers study vehicle guidance problems (VGPs). A vehicle guidance problem specifies an objective criteria with an initial state, goal state, dynamics, collision avoidance and other pertinent constraints for a vehicle. This library provides an abstraction layer between a VGP and its solver. With this library, researchers can spend less time developing software and more time studying problem formulations or assessing trajectory optimization algorithms.

## Build Instructions

ETOL is a C++ library that has been successfully built on Ubuntu 18.04 and Windows 10. Instructions for installing the required software for ETOL are provided [here](https://olasanni1.github.io/ETOL/setup/setup.html). The build commands are provided [here](https://olasanni1.github.io/ETOL/overview/build.html).

## Documentation

A getting started guide is available [here](https://olasanni1.github.io/ETOL/index.html). ETOL's application programming interface (API) documentation is available [here](https://olasanni1.github.io/etol_api/doxygen/html/index.html).
