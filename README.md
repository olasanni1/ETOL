# Extensible Trajectory Optimization Library (ETOL)

## Overview

The Extensible Trajectory Optimization Library (ETOL) was created to help researchers study vehicle guidance problems (VGPs). A vehicle guidance problem specifies an objective criteria with an initial state, goal state, dynamics, collision avoidance and other pertinent constraints for a vehicle. This library provides an abstraction layer between a VGP and its solver. With this library, researchers can spend less time developing software and more time studying problem formulations or assessing trajectory optimization algorithms.
